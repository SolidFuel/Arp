# solidArp

Stable Arpeggiator VST

**NEW** A [User Manual](docs/USER_MANUAL.md) is available

Most random arpeggiators do not give you the same pattern every time through.

This one does.

You can get it to randomize the velocity and gate as well. Those patterns will
also be stable.

Two other sets of algorithms are available:

- Linear - Up, Down, Zigzag
- Spiral - In, Out, InOut, OutIn
